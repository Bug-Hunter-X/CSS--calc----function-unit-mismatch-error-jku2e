The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, a common error arises when using it with units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly because the calculation involves a percentage and pixels, both length units.  However, an error occurs if you try to mix unrelated units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10s);` where 's' is not a valid CSS unit, causing the entire calculation to fail silently or produce unexpected results. This error is difficult to debug as the browser's error messages might be vague.
